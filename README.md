# The *Objectif Morse* project

Did you ever have this idea: what if there were two computers talking to each other using Morse code? One would send a message with light signals and the other would collect the light and understand the message? No cable connecting the computers. The information simply carried by light that travels through the air.

Well, here it is! The complete *Objectif Morse* project!

## Repository

This repository contains code and documentation for the *Objectif Morse* project - broadcasting and receiving messages in Morse alphabet between computers.

This project is aimed for explorers and experiments who are starting their journey with Arduino, electronic circuits and C/C++ programming.

Download this [PDF tutorial](https://github.com/camillejr/objectif_morse/raw/master/Documentation/Objectif_Morse.pdf) for the step by step project guide and enjoy the ride!
